Over the years, I have experimented with various forms of writing, including blogging and journaling. Sometime in 2023, I embarked on a new experiment: writing and publishing on here, with a specific focus on my professional pursuits.

I am writing to share my thoughts and thought processes, to keep a personal notebook of my thoughts, and to offer insights and questions that may benefit others in the future. Interestingly (and curiously!) enough, many of my ideas emerge or develop while I am engaged in the act of writing.

What am I writing about? A wide range of topics, but primarily centered around investor relations, investing, fintech, capital markets or whatever I find interesting and fascinating at the time that I want to gain a deeper understanding of. Significantly, the crux of my inquiry in those areas lies in envisioning the future and examining what it may look like.

In the process, I explore various trends, emerging technologies, and regulatory changes that could potentially shape the landscape of capital markets. By analysing and discussing these factors, I provide insights and perspectives that can assist investors, companies, and financial professionals in navigating the evolving market conditions.

Through this process of "figuring out loud," I strive to contribute to the ongoing dialogue surrounding the future of capital markets, fostering a deeper understanding and anticipation of the potential transformations that lie ahead.

Few articles on certain subjects are ‘ever-drafts’ and are designed to be always evolving. Few posts discuss the work of others and are tagged as ‘guests’. Every now and then, I pretend to be a podcast host, interview interesting people and share key insights here.

In a recent interview, Ludwig Sobolewski, one of the architects of modern Polish capital market and former CEO of the Warsaw Stock Exchange talking about the mindset of his team at the time of rapid change and development in post communist Poland:

"...it was relatively easy to introduce innovations, when you were building the whole thing from the scratch and you only need to have the internal courage and determination to achieve it"

Ludwig's words capture the very essence of my own cognitive process. They suggest that it may be more feasible to construct an entirely novel approach rather than attempting to enhance and expand upon an outdated model.

This blog is about this construction.
