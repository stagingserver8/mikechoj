Over the years, I have rotated through various writing projects, from blogging to journaling. In 2022, I have started a new experiment — I’ll write and publish regularly* on this site.

What’s my purpose? To share what I’m thinking, to share how I think, to keep a personal notebook of thoughts, to share ideas or questions that others could benefit from. Crucially (and curiously!), lot of ideas come up or develop while I am writing.

What am I writing about? A lot of different things, but mainly about the global capital market, investor relations, investing, and whatever I find interesting and fascinating at the time that I want to gain a deeper understanding of. And all of this in the context of impact of technology on each of those, which I think is the most interesting story of our time.

One of my beliefs is tihs technology is unlocking vast amount of new solutions for investors and companies, while introducing new opportunities. Opportunities to invest in new asset classes, opportunities to tell your story better, opportunities to access raise capital much more easily.

This newsletter delves into that journey focusing on those themes.

* A goal, not a promise!
