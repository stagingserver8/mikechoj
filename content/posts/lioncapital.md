Lions typically spend 15-20 hours per day sleeping, lounging in the shade and rarely standing up from their horizontal position. During the remaining part of the day, they transform into beasts and become the kings of the jungle. They are the fastest, most vicious, and alert creatures, capable of bringing down almost anything that stands in their way. Zebras, giraffes, or antelopes don’t stand a chance.

Their strong and compact bodies, powerful legs, and sharp teeth help them dominate the food chain, all within the short window that they are active. Lions do not mix hunting and resting. To hunt well in a short sprint period, they need to be well-rested and take their resting time seriously. It’s either this or that, never both.

Some of the best investors I know are like lions. They don’t stick to an agenda or follow a specific calendar routine. They spend most of their time reading, researching, and thinking by themselves in a quiet location. They have long and focused attention spans and rarely look at emails or follow the minute-by-minute news cycle. They know that being influenced by the outside world is a major disadvantage to their thought process.

Sometimes they will speak to other people in order to be challenged or to build a better understanding of a topic or a thought they are developing. But most of the time, it’s about figuring it out for themselves. No one really has all the answers.

But when an attractive opportunity appears on the horizon a few times a year, the investor will go for it with all their faculties.
