In the last few years, the digital asset ecosystem has experienced rapid growth in both scale and complexity.

To help us understand the space from top down, having a framework used to group investment ideas might be useful.

In the same way we think of gold as a commodity, Microsoft's shares as equity, and a T-bill as debt, we can also think of digital assets as falling into several different categories. Some of the most common types of digital assets today include cryptocurrencies, security tokens, utility tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and stable-coins. However, it becomes more complicated as you dive deeper.

To add more structure and granularity to this, MSCI, together with GS and CoinMetrics, developed a formal taxonomy for classifying this broad universe. Its method looks at four main classes (Digital Currencies, Blockchain Infrastructure, Digital Asset Application, and On-Chain Derivatives), each with sectors and sub-sectors.

MSCI is not the first in this. CoinDesk, a news site, has also developed their own taxonomy, called DACS (Digital Asset Classification Standard).

Why is this worth looking at?

Firstly, the framework can serve as a useful curriculum or map for understanding and learning about this new asset class. I have used this system to tag many of my pieces about digital asset projects that I come across. When I hear about a new crypto project, I like to come back here and get a feel for where it fits in this pie. It also allows for better comparisons between each project.

Secondly, I expect that in the future, the various sectors and sub-sectors here will decouple, each providing somewhat of a unique investment case and drivers. At the moment, it seems that most of the valuations of each of those groups are heavily correlated and dictated by flows to and from "crypto". Similarly, in the early days of the internet, anything online was considered one.

As the industry continues to evolve and new types of digital assets emerge, having a generally accepted taxonomy will be essential for investors and their managers to navigate this landscape effectively. The MSCI one is probably a good starting point.
