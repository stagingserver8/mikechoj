## 

Digital Currencies

Assets native to blockchains that primarily enable the transfer of value on a blockchain. These assets are typically the native cryptocurrency of a blockchain that does not
support decentralized applications.

Value Transfer Coins

Digital currencies native to blockchains whose primary purpose is to facilitate the transfer of value for general on-chain payments. Value Transfer Coins are typically used as
an incentive mechanism for participants to validate and secure its blockchain

Meme Coins

Digital currencies that are based on or derive value from memes and the social community that supports and engages with it on the internet. The value of these coins is driven by its
community members and is tied to the real, though intangible value of its social network.

Privacy Coins

Digital currencies that offer privacy enhancements to facilitate anonymous transfer of value for on-chain payments. Protocols of this type enable public blockchains to operate with anonymous features, allowing users to self-select when their on-chain data will be publicly available, or encrypted as an unidentifiable and untraceable
activity.

Remittance Coins

Digital currencies that prioritize velocity for the transfer of value domestically and across borders for payments. Remittance coins can be used as a medium to send money domestically or overseas to avoid traditional financial bottlenecks, such as high transaction costs, accessibility, and slow finality.

##

Blockchain Infrastructure

Tokens that are associated with
foundational protocols and utilities that support the development,
interoperability, scale, and growth of blockchain technologies.
Blockchain infrastructure tokens are native to their host protocol or
application and support its operations – whether that entails the
operations of a proprietary layer 1 blockchain, inter-chain
functionality, or multi-chain application use cases.

Smart Contract Platforms

Tokens native to
blockchain protocols that facilitate the execution of
smart contracts and power an ecosystem of
decentralized applications across a diverse set of use cases. These Smart Contract Platform tokens are not
only technically designed to support general purpose
decentralized apps, but also currently support and run
a diverse set of services and products from those
decentralized apps. Tokens of smart contract
platforms that primarily support a narrow type of
application or service are excluded.

##

Blockchain Utilities

Tokens issued by protocols that
aim to improve a blockchain’s core infrastructure for
increased scale, interoperability across blockchains, and ease
of running blockchain infrastructure These are typically
services that help existing blockchain protocols become
more scalable, cost efficient, or interoperable, or act as a
foundation to run blockchain infrastructure more easily.

Network Scaling

Tokens intended to
enhance a blockchain’s features, such as throughput,
consistency, and cost incurred to operate, by
extending upon a blockchain’s architecture and
conducting transactions outside of the settlement
layer, or “Layer 1”, of that blockchain. Often these
tokens and the protocols or technology on which they
run are labeled as “Layer 2 platforms”.

Cross-Chain Interoperability: Tokens native
to protocols that allow blockchains and their
applications and assets to interact and engage with
other distinct blockchains, often via “cross-chain
bridges”. These tokens are native to protocols that
serve to increase connectivity amongst chains rather
than by innovating on top of chains.

Blockchain Networks

Tokens that are
associated with the operations of a platform that
functions as the foundation for users to build and run
their own blockchains. Blockchain Networks also
enable the ability for each user’s blockchain or set of
blockchains to run, integrate, and interact with one
another in a low friction manner. Tokens in this
industry group are colloquially associated with “Layer
0 platforms”

##

Application Utilities

Tokens native to on-chain
products and services that support developers in building
their digital asset applications. These token’s products and
services generally service a wide variety of applications and
essentially allow for faster development, easier integration, and better connectivity to participants and data on and offchain

Oracles

Tokens native to applications that
connect data from the outside world (‘off-chain’) into
blockchain applications (‘on-chain’). Oracle networks
enable blockchain applications to perform complex
operations that cannot be done natively on-chain,
such as facilitating money markets using off-chain
market data.

Digital Identity 

Tokens native to
applications that designate, assign, and validate the
uniqueness of a name, human or domain on the
blockchain. Whereas on-chain data is public and
anonymous, digital identity tokens can be used to
create value via association with an off-chain entity or
used to create clarity for an on-chain party.

Governance Tools

Tokens native to
services that provide tools for the formation and / or
improvement of the operations of Decentralized
Autonomous Organizations (DAO’s) or other
decentralized groups. These tools cater to opensource protocols which promote their own adoption
for seamless building and integration between parties
acting toward a common goal.

Software Development

Tokens native to
applications that support smart contract
development, launching of applications on a
blockchain, and building a network of connectivity
with relevant participants. They typically provide
toolkits of software development kits (SDKs) with
standardized proesses to leverage and streamline
development. 

## 

Digital Asset Applications

 Tokens native to the operations of an
on-chain application that was developed to provide a specific service
or product to blockchain users. These applications can run on top of
general purpose blockchain infrastructure, like smart contract
platforms, or run on their own application-specific blockchain

Decentralized Finance

Tokens native to decentralized
applications that provide the user with economic interest,
trading power, or an on-chain alternative to traditional
financial services and products. These tokens often serve as
the mechanism to engage with its financial application as
well as the reward that is used to collateralize or compensate
the user for the financial activity that the protocol offers.


 Decentralized Exchanges
 
Tokens native to
the operations of an automated market maker for
token spot markets, enabling peer to peer transfer of
assets through liquidity pools. These tokens are
utilized as a tool to maintain liquidity and balance
while conducting two-way flow through the exchange.

Derivatives Trading

Tokens native to the
operations of an application that facilitates the
creation and transfer of derivatives and synthetic
assets. The token will enable access and liquidity to a
derivative/synthetic product that is uniquely offered
and distributed by the protocol which the token helps
to operate. These tokens are not the derivatives
themselves, but rather facilitate activity in derivatives

Decentralized Lending

Tokens native to the
operations of an automated market maker that
primarily provides lending and borrowing services,
enabling peer to peer loans via liquidity pools.
Decentralized lending protocols allow users to borrow
or lend against other tokens, while the other side of
the transaction is held and collateralized in the native
decentralized lending token. Rewards from using the
lending protocol are also denominated in this token.

Stablecoin Issuers

Tokens native to
applications that facilitate the secondary issuance of
their own stablecoin. Stablecoin Issuer tokens
operate and govern protocols which are balanced
against, or interoperable with, a stablecoin issued by
the same protocol. Stablecoin issuer tokens should
not be confused with stablecoin tokens themselves –
though there may be some overlapping activities
between the two.

Prediction Markets

Tokens native to
decentralized marketplaces that are used for
speculative trading based on the outcome of future
events. Prediction market protocols allow users to
place bets on certain events or data. These tokens are
used as participation mechanisms as well as reward
currency.

Asset Management

Tokens native to
applications that provide management services for
investment portfolios often to optimize yields or
manage risk. This industry group includes applications colloquially referred to as staking
platforms, yield farms or yield aggregators.

Crowdfunding

Tokens native to
applications that reduce frictions for peer-to-peer
investment to raise funding for a given project or
group. These tokens function as governance tools
where capital is allocated to various initiatives as
proposed by decentralized communities.

Insurance

Tokens native to applications
that cover against smart contract failure, exchange
hacks, or other blockchain-related risks from
transaction or holding digital assets. Insurance
applications aim to share risk across its users
together without the need for an insurance company
and rather have its service entirely run by its
members.


##

Media Services

Tokens native to applications for
facilitating the distribution of content and communication
across various mediums. Tokens of this sort often empower
more decentralized ownership of social media or
entertainment content. They are often accredited with giving
data ownership of creators and application users back to the
original owners, eliminating third party data aggregators and
middlemen.

Advertising

Tokens native to applications
that facilitate the tokenization of impressions for
interacting with advertisements. These tokens
correspond with the web user’s viewership whereby
they are rewarded in the advertising token for the
attention they provide advertisers.

Content & Streaming

Tokens native to
applications that support the creation and
broadcasting of creative content, such as video,
music, or art, and enable social interactions between
users and communities. The tokens power the
network, allowing creators to communicate and
distribute content autonomously and reward
themselves directly with the native token associated
with the protocol that maintains their data and
content.

##

On-Chain Derivatives

Tokens that are based on or have value
linked or derived from a different underlying asset or group of assets.
The underlying asset(s) can exist on-chain or off-chain. Tokens that
are pegged to a particular value or operate under a stabilization
mechanism rather than backed by an underlying asset are included in
this sector

Stablecoins

Tokens which are pegged to a specific
sovereign-issued currency. Stablecoins are intended to offer
participants in the digital asset ecosystem access to
blockchain applications and decentralized protocols without
facing exposure to price action in digitally native tokens.
There are several methods which allow for stablecoin
creation – these range from providing real world or digital
assets which back the stablecoin on a one-to-one basis, to
computer-driven mechanics which aim to keep a stablecoin
peg consistent.

 Fiat-Backed Stablecoins
 
Stablecoins that
are backed by cash and cash-like equivalents, or ‘fiat’.
The value of each token has a tangible backing that gives it inherent value in the event of redemption of
the stablecoin back to fiat.


Crypto-Backed Stablecoins

Stablecoins
that are backed by cryptocurrencies. These tokens are
backed by a vault which stores reserves of
cryptocurrencies whose value in sum equates to the
same fiat value as the issued stablecoin. Maintaining
the peg for these stablecoins requires the issuer to
actively manage the funds available in the vault to
ensure that any price change in the vault’s assets is
paired with the appropriate supply and demand
dynamic to hold the stablecoin value constant.

Algorithmic Stablecoins

Stablecoins that
maintain their peg using a set of rules determined by
a protocol, often created by a Stablecoin Issuer. The
set of rules is an algorithmic arrangement which
incentivizes the holders of the token to interact with
the stablecoin for monetary gain in order to maintain
the peg. This normally takes place in the form of
arbitraging the token.

##

Tokenized Assets

Tokens that represent or provide
exposure to another asset, on-chain or off-chain, and are
pegged to the value of that underlying asset. These tokens
typically help facilitate activity in the underlying asset on a
blockchain that the asset did not exist on before.

Asset-Backed Tokens

Tokenized assets
that are backed by other assets, such as
cryptocurrencies, securities, or commodities. The
underlying assets backing these tokens are typically
held in a segregated account on or off-chain.

Synthetic Tokens: Tokens that mimic the
one-to-one value or price of another asset, such as
cryptocurrencies, securities, or commodities. These
tokens provide exposure to a particular asset without
having to hold or own the asset itself.

## 

Metaverse

Tokens associated with a virtual
ecosystem enabled by blockchains to facilitate the ownership
and transfer of digital property Although nearly any type of
product and service can exist in the metaverse, metaverse
tokens are defined to be native to applications that facilitate
the ownership of a digital property.

Virtual Worlds

Tokens native to
applications that facilitate the transfer of ownership
of and interaction with digital land. Virtual worlds
serve as the metaverse backdrop, wherein all things
on-chain related to metaverse will live. Virtual worlds
and their tokens thereby provide access and property
rights in the virtual world.


Gaming

Tokens native to applications for
blockchain-based gaming and their communities.
Decentralized gaming applications will include a
native token to incentivize players with monetary
rewards based on their participation and success in
the game. These tokens can then be used further
within the game to purchase in-game virtual assets,
for example related to avatars or special upgrades.


NFT Ecosystems

Tokens associated with
applications in which non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can
be created, bought, sold, or transferred. The NFTs can
represent a creative project and are usually deemed
to be rare or unique. These applications can operate
on a decentralized or a centralized basis and facilitate
transactions in a local or digital currency. NFTs are
presently out of classification scope.


## 

Claim Tokens

Tokens that entitle the holder to credit
toward an underlying asset. Claim tokens represent an
underlying asset that was lent or staked to earn interest.

Liquidity Pool Tokens: 

Claim tokens that
represent a share of a liquidity pool provisioned by a
protocol that facilitates economic activity. Liquidity
Pool, or “LP”, tokens allow the holder to control their
share of the underlying pool. These tokens can be transferred, exchanged, and even staked on other
protocols.

Staked Tokens

Claim tokens that represent
an asset that is staked on a blockchain or application.
Staking is the act of depositing assets to an
application or blockchain protocol to earn rewards
and better the security of that application or
blockchain protocol.
