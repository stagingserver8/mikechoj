Below are a few entry level skills, which are deemed useful foundational level skills, while starting out.
Many of those I have stress tested on myself, some are borrowed from other seasoned investors or analysts that I respect.

# Ability to concentrate (culitaving a long attention span)

This was a big one and probably the biggest one for me to overcome. Being able to concentrate for a long periods of time. Personally, I have had real difficulty doing this, and unless this and over the years have created my own concentration training, which involved using a timer to check how long can I sustain a given level of focus. It also involved having a physical task list of things I do and check them off, without moving to another task.

I have found 

# Habit of reading

Berkshire Hathaway’s Charlie Munger said that he really liked Albert Einstein’s point that “success comes
from curiosity, concentration, perseverance and self-criticism. And by self-criticism, he meant the ability to
change his mind so that he destroyed his own best-loved ideas [^1].

The starting point is to have a daily habit of reading. What to read?

good readers tend to take on material across a wide spectrum of disciplines. Don’t just read in
business or finance. Expand the scope into new domains or fields. Follow your curiosity. It is hard to know
when an idea from an apparently disparate field may come in handy.

In my own reading practice, I have structured it:

-Firstly, there is value in starting covering essential history of financial markets and having foundational knowledge in the topic of investing: human behaviour, accounting
-Secondly, reading broadly to try to understand current dynamics in the markets. Not neccesarily day in and day out, but generally having a good feel 
-Thirdly, reading to get to hone in your own area of investing expertise
-Forthy, reading broadly; anything that touches your curiosity. Books, blogs, long form article pieces. There is no structure. Read broadly and widely.

I try to maintain a library of great material online.

How to manage content you come across? 

I have learned to use pocket app, which I have both on my phone and ipad.
I try to carve out an hour or two during the day.

I have also created a small house which is a dedicated reading/writing/thinking area.


# Habit of synthesizing of what you have learnt

Are you able to explain what you just read to a friend? What are the main things that the book, speaker, company, etc is trying to convey to you? 

For the this was starting a habit of writing a monthly newsletter. The format of this newsletter would change over the years, but essentially it would be a newsletter providing highlevel update of the markets, your portfolio, what is changing, what interesting things you are reading, what events you have attended etc.

I have found writing a very rewarding. Writing about anything relevant. Investment themes, conferences I attended, foundational material. Reading interesting areas you write about and then putting it into  your own words, or adding your own spin to it. 

# Open mindedness & ability to change your views (probabilistic thinking)

One way to do this is the map out all the outcomes and assumptions 


# Creating your own investment strategy

Characters of good investors, thinking freely, reflect that of

Time spent alone helped me figure out what I am 

What am I interested in? What is my angle? What am I genuinly interested in.

The benefit of a very long term 



In my case a few things came up

Firstly, investment horizon. When creating this strategy, I wanted to look at the period of 100+ years. I wanted to institutionalise and have an investment process that would 

1- Having a 100 year+ investment horizon. So I would be most interested in long term trends.
2- Not worrying about what happens in the market on a day to day basis. Up and down markets should not really influence.
3- Collection of productive assets (high quality and scarce) some of which you craft with highest amount of attention
4- Thematic interest in technology & financial markets. In those areas I might decide to take bets on individual securities, the rest will be done by ETFs and mainly passive expsoure.
