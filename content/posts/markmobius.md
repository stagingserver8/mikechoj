## Transcript

Michael Chojnacki:

What are timeless principles or timeless investment strategies that have helped you
guide you through crises such as this one or the next one that will that will come
across?

Mark Mobius:

Well, you know, the key word I would say is transparency. I know in the case of you
know, being a fund manager like I've been so many years you achieve trust from
your clients by being completely transparent. And that means you've got to give
them the bad news as long as along with the good news, you got to be very
transparent with them. In that sense. People are human, they understand that there
are problems, you will run into problems. And if you're frank with them, then their
competence gets built up. The great thing about what we're witnessing now with
this COVID-19 is that companies and we as fund managers have had to
communicate in a much more forceful way. And the use of the internet and all of the
telephonic mechanisms that we have, just like this conversation we're having here
now is giving us a whole new way of communicating with people even though we're
not meeting face to face. So some ways it's a great test. Companies now have a
challenge. No longer are they able to receive visitors to their company for one
reason or another because of the lockdowns, etc. But they can communicate the
way we're communicating now and through the internet with their Facebook page or
their blog or whatever. So it's really a very, very interesting transition that we're
going through now.

Michael Chojnacki:

And how do you feel about this transition? I know that you and your team, you're
big fans of going into the markets, meeting the companies, speaking to the
management. I know that you've spoken a lot about body language being a big part
of what you're doing.

Mark Mobius:

Well, I still believe it's very important to have face to face communication because
you can read the body language as you've mentioned. But the fact that we're now
making many more calls to companies rather than visiting them, in some ways has
increased our knowledge because we're able to, instead of traveling thousand miles

to visit a company, and spending a heck of a lot of money doing so, we can now
make three or four calls in one month. And you get different people from the
company on the phone, or on a zoom video like this. So there are pluses and
minuses, but I would say a combination of both would be the best, having the face
to face, plus the kind of thing we're doing now.

Michael Chojnacki:

What would you think are, you know, before we dive in into specifically Investor
Relations, what would you think are maybe some of the big themes right now that
will be impacting the sentiment for emerging market as an asset class, you know,
more from kind of from a big picture that you're looking at

Mark Mobius:

Well, the first key change has to do with technology. In other words, it has now
become very, very clear to people in emerging countries that they have to move up
the technology ladder very quickly. So for example, if you're a retailer in South
Africa, you'd better have an internet page, you'd better have a system for selling
goods on the internet, etc, etc. Because it's become almost a requirement that
you've got to do this. And you've got to do a lot more communication on the
internet. So I would say the technological impact on emerging markets has been
more dramatic. The good news is that these emerging market countries are able to
leapfrog over the old technology, so they can now bring in the latest technology to
their country or to their company. And that gives them an incredible advantage in
many ways. So it's really good news for many of these companies in emerging
markets and the countries themselves.

Michael Chojnacki:

The evolving US-China relationship, which I think is, you know, also in a lot of the
minds of EM managers. I know that you spend a lot of time out there. What is the
best framework to think about the evolution of that relationship? And what impact it
will have on other countries? Or maybe, you know, what are the most helpful
questions to ask going forward, about how that relationship will impact?

Mark Mobius:

Well, as you know, China has been the center of supply chains globally, for quite
some time now. And one of the changes taking place, of course, because of the US
tariffs is that supply changes, price change, changes are taking place. With a
number of companies in China moving their manufacturing base to other countries,
particularly a lower labor cost countries, and, of course, one reason is the US trade
war. But the other reason is that they are faced with higher wages in China anyway.
So they had to go this path. In any event. The other thing that's happening is that
you're seeing a much more realistic view of trade and international agreements. So
we're being shifted from a multilateral world where, you know, all countries get
together in a room and agree to one rule for everybody to a unilateral world where
two countries sit down and work out a program. So I think that's the big change that
Trump has sort of forced on the rest of the world. And I don't think it's necessarily a
bad thing because I think the negotiations, the trade relations are going to be on a
much sounder putting, much stronger footing as a result of that. The other good
news is that Trump is a businessman. He's a practical businessman. And the good
thing is that the Chinese also are very practical. So yes, the negotiations will be very
*** sticky. Trump will do one thing the next day in order to get the Chinese off
balance, the Chinese will do something else. But at the end of the day, I think the
dialogue will be successful. And the relationship will continue. And by the way, a lot
of people say, oh, we are going, you know, globalization is over. No, globalization is
not over. When you consider the incredible reach of communications around the
world. We're going to see bigger and bigger relationships and tighter relationships
between countries.

Michael Chojnacki:

Is there anything that you have changed your mind on when you look at the last
perhaps 12 months, which have been, you know, a little bit of a roller coaster in
some regards. Is there anything that you've changed your mind, how you look at the
companies, industries, countries?

Mark Mobius:

Of course, you know, we were very concerned about the balance sheets of all the
companies in which we've been investing. Because obviously, any company without
a strong balance sheet will be in trouble. And that's one thing. It hasn't really
changed our mind, but we put more emphasis on that, on balance sheet. The other
thing we've done is we've said: Hey, everything has gone down dramatically. Let's
get rid of those companies that we were not too happy with for one reason or
another. And let's stock up on the other that we were waiting to buy now it gives us
an opportunity to buy. So in that sense, we've changed our mind *** with regards
to the existing portfolio and been doing some switching.

Michael Chojnacki:

Talking a little bit about your investment process. I'll be very interested to know
maybe if we can deconstruct the investment process. I'll be very interested to know
how a company in an emerging market comes from being a ticker on a computer
screen to be sitting in your portfolio, and very interested to hear what is the role of
the investor relation team in that company in influencing that decision for you and is
that you know, and how valuable that role is, keeping in mind that we have, you
know, all the information out there on on various terminals.

Mark Mobius:

I think you've made a very good point when you say that, you know, everybody has
the information that's out there, people just go into Bloomberg or Capital IQ, and so
lots of information. So because we use that, we do scans of companies, and we
focus on things like return on assets, return on capital employed, we look of course
at earnings growth, we look at the balance sheet, what's the debt equity, we look at
all these different factors And filter down to those companies that we're interested in
looking at more deeply. Then we call the investor relations people and see if they
are amenable to talk. A surprising number of companies really are not that set up.
They don't have Investor Relations people, they often don't even have an internet,
blog or presentation that they can send on the internet. So we of course have to ask
about that. Now, I'm not saying it's a very bad thing. Because if they don't have it,
then there may be an opportunity for us to go in and advise them how to do that,
and thereby increase the value of the company. So we put a lot of emphasis on our
ability to have a dialogue with the company. So that's the first step. The next step is
that we then want to talk to the top management whether it's be the President or
chairman of the board or whatever, we want to talk to these people, because these
are the people that are calling the shots. If they're unwilling to talk, that's a bad
sign. Because it means that they're not very interested in the investors. If they are
willing to talk, then the next thing we ask them is, are you willing to have a dialogue
with us to improve your investor relations? And they may ask: Well, why are you
asking that? And the answer is that we can help you increase your share price, if you
have a good Investor Relations program, and investors perceive you as being
investor friendly. So that would be the step, the next step that we take the most
important step. Now if a company is saying no, I'm not interested in that, then we
don't invest. Now, we're very much focused on corporate governance, how to
improve corporate governance.

Michael Chojnacki:

What makes a good impression? So let's say you just left a meeting with the CEO,
what will be a good feeling? Or how will the meeting go within the company that
would leave you with a very positive impression? And equally, what would be a bad
meeting, maybe aside of the things that you've just mentioned.

Mark Mobius:

A good meeting is when after an hour, they say, we'd be happy to answer any more
questions you may have. Yeah, you know, they're willing to spend the time so that's
a good, very good sign. The other good sign is that someone in addition to the
investor relations person, someone from the executive level is on the call. That's also
a very good sign. So I would say those are two very critical points. And by the way,
very often you will get a situation like recently we had with a company in China.
Where the chairman did not speak English. But they got a translator to translate for
him. Well, we appreciate that because that meant they went through a lot of trouble
to get someone and the fact that the chairman was willing to go on the call. So
these are little signs that you get from companies that give you confidence that
you're going to be able to have a dialogue going forward.

Michael Chojnacki:

And what defines a brilliant CEO or brilliant management team in that regard?

Mark Mobius:

The best definition is the person who answers the questions asked. This is very, very
important. Because very often you will ask a question. And the IR team or the
executive will go off on a tangent and tell them, tell you what they want you to hear.
This is not a good sign. It means they're not listening to you, number one, or they
may be hiding something. So very important for the executives and the IR team to
answer the questions that are being asked.

Michael Chojnacki:

And if you were appointed Mark, as a head of investor relations for a company in an
emerging market, what would be your, let's say priorities in the first 100 days on the
job,

Mark Mobius:

First of all, get ab Internet site and put your company information on that site. And
hopefully, if you have a budget, hire someone to do a very nice presentation of your
company, because that is usually the first step that people have. The second thing I
would do is, well, first of all, get an IR person there are many companies out there
without an IR person, so that's number one. And you've got to get an IR person
who's at the same level, as the analysts that he or she is talking to. So usually that
is a person who has been on the sell side, or the buy side in the industry who can
really talk intelligently about the company. And we've had many cases when the IR
person was able to give us a much more comprehensive picture of the company,
then the executive vice president. So this is very important. The third thing I would
do is do press releases. In other words, if the company is started a new plant, or has
hired a new executive, then put out a press release announcing that, why it's been
done, and what the result is expected to be. So these are some of the things that
you would do, that I would do if I was sitting in that position. Another thing, by the
way, it's very important for the IR person to get to know the company well. That
means sitting down with the executives, moving around with the executives, touring
the plant, generally, you know, be in a position where he or she becomes the expert
about the company.

Michael Chojnacki:

Those were very useful building blocks. Mark, I wanted to briefly talk about
something that's on the minds of many IR people around the world is MiFID II
regulations. It's been some time since it was introduced. I'm just curious to know
what do you think the impact of MiFID II regulation is on Investor Relations, on
research, and on the investment management space?

Mark Mobius:

It's been a disaster. All I can tell, you MiFID has been a disaster. It was the biggest
mistake that... Again, European Union is making mistakes all over the place, but this
is one of the biggest mistakes. And the reason for that is that they killed a lot of
research. With the previous MiFID we could get free research from any broker and
they of course, would want to have some compensation in terms of trading. Of
course, we got it, we had to make sure that the trading was fair, we were getting
the right price, etc, etc. So, and more importantly, it allowed smaller brokers to
survive. Now a lot of small brokers I had a business. And also it enabled smaller
investors to get access to research that they otherwise would not be able to get. So
now with MiFID, you have two things: further consolidation of the brokerage
industry, with a lot of small brokers out of business, and small investors being
disadvantaged, because they're not getting the research that they were able to get
before. So I think MiFID has been a real disaster.

Michael Chojnacki:

So if I am let's say, a small cap company, and there is a lot less research written on
me, as an investor relation team as a management team, is the expectation for me
to be doing more of that communication to the market?

Mark Mobius:

By the way, that's a very good point you've raised. I should have mentioned that
earlier. The next step for the IR manager would be to get in contact with large
investors around the world, pension funds, asset management companies, etc, etc.
When I say large, they don't have to be giants, they can be running maybe 200
million or 500 million, because these are companies that could really make a
difference in terms of your share price. Now contact these people and tell them who
you are, offer to speak to them about the company, etc. So, because as you know,
the problem with MiFID is that before MiFID brokers would do that job. Now the
brokers are more focused on only large companies, they're not interested in finding
new opportunities with some exceptions. But that's something that the IR manager
should be doing.

Michael Chojnacki:

In terms of losing credibility, with the buy side, what is probably the easiest way a
company can lose credibility within investors such as yourself.

Mark Mobius:

Not telling the truth, that's number one. Making statements that are not true. That is
very bad. The other thing would be if something bad happens, not coming out
quickly, and explaining what happened, it was a mistake, admit the mistake and say, we're going to make changes. These are the changes we're going to make to
improve the situation, etc, etc. So that's what I mean, complete transparency is
essential.

Michael Chojnacki:

I want to spend a bit of time talking about ESG investing specifically. I'll be just very
interested in how do you look at a company and how does ESG feature in your
investment decision process?

Mark Mobius:

You're absolutely right. There are a lot of organizations now that are doing scoring
of ESG credentials for companies, but usually they are dealing with only very large
companies. And the companies that we invest in are large with a few exceptions of
smaller companies and medium sized companies that don't have these scores, so we
have to do it ourselves. So before we go into a company, we look at the industry.
Now, if it's a mining company, we have to look very, very carefully at what kind of
mining they're doing, what reports in the past they had regarding pollution, etc, etc.
So we do a lot of book research to find out if there are any so called skeletons in the
closet as regards to the environment, without the social, how has been their labor
relations, etc, etc. But our main emphasis is on the governance. So what we then do
is, like I mentioned, after we've done the research, or we decided that the numbers
look reasonably good, we're going to go in, no big E and S problems. We then call
the company and talk about governance and ask them whether they're willing to
work with us to improve the governance. And of course, we point out, look, all the
board members are members of the founding family. That's not a good idea. So
then we'll talk to them about that. Or we'll ask him, why haven't you paid dividends
when you've got all this cash in the balance sheet? So we'll go through a number of
things like that, and work with them with the idea of improving their governance and
thereby improving the receptivity in the market.

Michael Chojnacki:

And what has been your general experience in terms of how receptive generally
companies are towards, you know, towards that level of improvement?

Mark Mobius:

We found that roughly 50% of the companies that we contact are not willing to
enter into any dialogue and not willing to change. The remaining 50% they say yes,
we'd like to work with you, etc, etc. But we then find out that it's only lip service. In
other words, they really don't want to change, because maybe it's a family company.
Brothers and sisters are on the board of directors. There's no oversight for the
directors, and they're not going to change. So in that case, although we may have
started off on the right foot, we eventually lose faith, and we sell the stock. So I
would say, at the end of the day, we're maybe talking about 25% of the companies
that we contact. Remember that the world is changing in the sense that more and
more people and therefore companies becoming aware of big issues. And you've
seen the whole issue of black lives matter, how many big companies are coming out
and saying, look, we're going to look at our board of directors, how many people we
have from different ethnic backgrounds, etc, etc. So I think things are going to
change. And time is on our side in that respect.

Michael Chojnacki:

And I think, you know, you mentioned a couple of times that the G part is probably
most important. But I was just wondering, is there anything else that kind of makes
a company fantastic, and corporate governance scores very, very high versus just
kind of okay.

Mark Mobius:

That's one of the reasons why we like to tour companies and visit the factories and
look around, because the morale of the staff is very, very important. If a company
has a very unified and happy staff, then this is a great, great sign of good corporate
governance. And of course, allied to that related to that is the receptivity of the top
management, to listening, to be listening to the staff in the company, because that
will create a wonderful opportunity for a better cooperation among the staff
members. And by the way, this also starts at the board level. If you have, for
example, a huge bar board and a lot of contention at the board level. A lot of fights
and disagreements, that's not a good sign. And it goes, that'll filter down through
the organization. So usually we like companies with relatively small boards,
companies that have a woman on the board. Women are very important to give
another view of what's happening. If they have, you know, different backgrounds of
the board. One of the good things in Germany, by the way here in Germany is that
these companies normally have a representative from labor on the board. I mean,
this is a good practice. So this is the kind of thing we see as improving the
governance. Among many other factors.

Michael Chojnacki:

And I want to touch maybe on just one additional, which is the shareholder
structure, the shareholder base of the company. How does that affect your
investment decision? Do you favor companies with more retail, with more
institutions? How does the shareholder structure impact and what would be kind of
an acceptable shareholder structure, which you would appreciate?

Mark Mobius:

Actually a very interesting question and very good one because what we found is
that if you have a shareholder who is a private equity firm, that is a good sign
because a private equity firm will look at the company like we look at it, but maybe
even more intensely. So you look at the shareholder structure of the company, and
you see: Oh 20% is owned by this private equity firm. Well, that's probably a sign
that this private equity firm is having a dialogue with the company, wants to make
changes as a real *** stake at the company, and vice versa. The company is more
likely to be listening to this big shareholder. So I would say that is one good sign. By
the way, we're not against family companies. Family companies can be very good as
long as they have a board of directors who are independent. We'll give them new
ideas, and willing to come up with the criticisms if necessary.

Michael Chojnacki:

And one of the things is, you mentioned, also the lack of transparency in a lot of the
markets. Access to information, as you pointed out, is extremely important. And I'm
just wondering, how do you go around looking at companies or markets where there
is not a lot of transparency?

Mark Mobius:

Well, the unfortunate situation in the financial world is that people who are in
government, the regulators, often, unfortunately, are not paid as much as they
should be paid. So usually their tenure with the regulator is a preparation to join the
private sector at a much higher income. So that immediately sets up a conflict of
interest as number one. Number two is these regulators because they don't have the
resources at their disposal, that the private sector has, they end up behind the eight
ball so to speak. In other words, they're too late, they're not up to date with what's
happening. And they tend to also isolate themselves from the market too much. In
other words, they say that, we're regulators, we've got to be separate. If you read the Madoff story, you know that there was one gentleman, a Greek gentleman who was telling the SEC that this guy is a crook. But they weren't listening. They were not willing to go into the details. And that's, that is
a real problem. So we need regulators, no question about that. But we need
regulators who really have people there who are very well paid, better than the
industry. I can give you one example now. Many years ago, we were investing in a
company in Brazil at the palm store. And, as usual, we would visit the company
every year or maybe twice a year, talk to the auditor, to talk to the accountant,
Chief Accountant. Everything seemed to be fine. All of a sudden, company was
bankrupt, assets were missing. What happened? We tried to hire lawyers, of course,
all the lawyers were conflicted because the controlling family was a big family.
Finally, after a year, we went to the regulator. And we went to the reception and
said: look, we'd like to talk to someone about this company. And she said: fine. And
she called somebody, and the gentleman coming out, was the former finance
director of this company. So there was nothing we could do. You know, this is the
conflict that you have. So we've had a number of cases like that where we, you
know, get *** no satisfaction from the regulator.

Michael Chojnacki:

That's very interesting. And I think on this point, I'll be very interested to hear, you
know, perhaps what have been some of the most painful investment experiences
that you draw, maybe the most amount of lessons from. Is there a favorite failure or
favorite lesson?

Mark Mobius:

Well, we are learning every day. But in one case, we invested in Russia, in a Russian
company who did food products. And we were following them, of course very
closely. But suddenly, earnings went down dramatically. And we, of course, call the
company, find out what was happening. It was no answer, no one was available. So
we quickly said, look, let's try to save the assets. Let's look at where the assets
were. Now, we know we know they had purchased a company in New Zealand. So
we started to investigate that company. But unfortunately, this is another problem
you have, if you start hiring lawyers, lawyers are too slow. And because by the time
the lawyers got around to going to the regulator and the lawyers just happened to
be registered in Singapore, it was too late the assets were gone. So that's one
example of where we lost our *** as a result of it.

Michael Chojnacki:

I just have a final few questions. Next one is about information filtering. So with so
much information out there, how do you choose articles, newspapers, books,
podcasts, blogs and so forth? How do you choose your sources of information that
provide you the most amount of insights into into some of those markets, which
many of which as we pointed out, are not very transparent. What has been your
methodology on there?

Mark Mobius:

That is a very, very good question, particularly now with a lot of so called fake news
that we have on the internet or the popular press, etc, etc. So I would say it's
actually become more difficult in the sense that maybe we were naive in the past
where if we picked up the New York Times, or the Washington Post, or we turn on
CNBC or whatever, we would, you know, get news that was very credible. But now,
all these sources are quite biased, we found, so you've got to look at many different
sources to get to check and double check. So, for example, I just was reading a
book on corruption in the medical field of how sometimes medical results are fixed
and altered. There's a good example where the author doesn't have a very good
reputation. But what she was talking about was quite relevant and required us to
look more deeply into the subject. So what I do is I have I pick up the New York
Times, I pick up the Financial Times, I pick up the Washington Post, I look at all the
channels, I look at CNBC, CNN, Fox, and then try to put them all together to make
some sense of the space, so to speak. And I think that's the only choice. Now, of
course, the problem is that there's so much coming at us these days, is that we do
have to filter. And we have to have, shall I say, try to condense as much as possible.
Well, I think the key after all is set and done, you've got to dig into the company
that you're looking at more deeply. You've got to get to know the people behind the
company. And through that, then you can go to the industry. So example. We were
looking at a company, a pharmaceutical company that dealt in Botox related
products. So we went to pretty much depth with this company. But then we started
asking the company, Hey, what about the industry, your competitors, what industry
conferences you go to, etc, etc. So then we could widen our search and learn more
about the environment for this company?

Michael Chojnacki:

What advice would you give to a young investor starting his or her career in
emerging market investing?

Mark Mobius:
Read, read, read, study as much as you can. And keep an open mind. Don't let
people bias you in any direction. I mean, even when we're sitting down with
somebody who may seem to be very credible, we always will question. We always
double check the facts. Don't go along with the crowd. You know, unfortunately, you
see a lot of that these days, there's a tendency to join the crowd, and to go along
with the crowd. This is a big mistake. Be very open minded and be ready to question
everything.

Michael Chojnacki:

I'm already out of my questions. Mark it has been tremendously useful. Is there
anything that you want to maybe add that we haven't covered today about
corporate governance, best practice IR from a company's perspective? Any any final
words of feedback, or advice?

Mark Mobius:

Well, I think the key word is being optimistic, I think. Despite all the challenges we
have, the bottom line is most people are very good. People are very nice, generally
speaking. So you can pretty much trust people, but also you have to question, but
be optimistic. That's the key.
